/* Internal-fd reservation.
 *
 * tawcroot keeps a handful of long-lived fds open across guest
 * execution: the rootfs O_PATH fd, one O_PATH fd per `-b src:dst`
 * bind, the linkstore dirfds, tier-3 socket parent dirs, and the shm
 * segments. If the guest can `close()` those, our handler's `*at` calls
 * start failing, *or worse* — the kernel could later assign that slot
 * to a guest-opened file, after which our path translator would route
 * guest opens through whatever inode the guest chose.
 *
 * Mitigation: dup every internal fd to a high number (at or above
 * `TAWCROOT_RESERVED_FD_BASE`), record it in `tawcroot_reserved_fds[]`,
 * and trap the fd-shape syscalls (`close`, `close_range`, `dup`,
 * `dup2`, `dup3`, `fcntl`, `fchdir`, `getdents*`). The trapping
 * handlers make every recorded fd return `-EBADF` from the guest's
 * perspective, exactly as if the fd were never opened.
 *
 * The base is a *placement* floor (and a BPF fast-path floor), not a
 * range we own. The guest may legitimately hold fds above it: nothing
 * traps `setrlimit`, Android's soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` is already 32768+,
 * and the kernel hands out fds past 1000 as soon as a guest opens that
 * many. Every handler decision here is therefore an exact membership
 * test against the table. Treating the whole half-space `[BASE, ∞)` as
 * ours — the shape this file used to describe — meant `dup2`/`F_DUPFD`
 * failed on the guest's own descriptors and `close_range` silently
 * skipped them (an fd leak across exec for exactly the programs careful
 * enough to closefrom).
 *
 * What keeps our fds and the guest's disjoint is the kernel: it never
 * hands out an fd number that is already open, so a reservation
 * (`fcntl(F_DUPFD*, BASE)`) can never land on a live guest fd, and no
 * guest open can land on one of ours. The only route by which a guest
 * can name a specific number is `dup2`/`dup3` with an explicit `newfd`
 * (rejected with `-EBADF` when it names a reserved fd) — plus
 * `pidfd_getfd`, which we don't implement. The corollary is that a
 * number we stop using must leave the table *before* the kernel can
 * recycle it: see `tawcroot_fd_forget_reserved`.
